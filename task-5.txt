										Task 5  : Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark.
 

Objective: Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.
 Tools: Wireshark (free).
 Deliverables:  A packet capture (.pcap) file and a short report of protocols identified




--> Steps Performed:

1. Installed Wireshark]and launched the application.

2. Selected the active network interface – in this case, Ethernet0.

3. Started capturing packets on Ethernet0.

4. To generate network traffic:

   * Opened YouTube to create multimedia traffic (video streaming).
   * Used the ping command to contact an external server (generates ICMP traffic).
   * Visited a dummy website using the HTTP protocol (non-secure).

5. On the HTTP site, entered dummy login credentials: `username/admin123`.

6. After about a minute, stopped the capture.


--> Key Observations:

* Searched for the entered credentials in the captured traffic.
* Found the username and password clearly visible in HTTP packets.
* This demonstrates packet sniffing, where data can be read if the connection is not encrypted.
* Realized that HTTP is not safe for transmitting sensitive data — always use HTTPS.


--> Protocol Analysis:

* Filtered and identified several protocols from the capture:

  * TCP – used for reliable communication (e.g., YouTube traffic).
  * UDP – used for faster, connectionless traffic.
  * ICMP – from ping commands.
  * HTTP – captured from the dummy login site.

* Exported filtered packets into separate `.pcap` files (e.g., `tcp_.pcap`, `udp_.pcap`, etc.) for further analysis or submission.


--> Conclusion / Learnings:

* Tools like Wireshark can expose how data travels over a network.
* Unsecured protocols (like HTTP) can leak private information.
* Always ensure websites use HTTPS to keep credentials and data safe.
* Learned how to capture, analyze, filter, and export network traffic.
